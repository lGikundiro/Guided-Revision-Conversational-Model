The field of adaptive guided revision will play a vital role in modern education by personalizing learning experiences to meet individual student needs. As education systems increasingly adopt digital tools, an adaptive model that can understand and respond to student input will become essential for effective learning outcomes.
The objective of this project is to develop and compare traditional and deep learning approaches for predicting a student’s academic level and understanding based on their revision questions. By identifying a student’s level accurately, the system can generate revision questions that are progressively and appropriately challenging, thereby supporting continuous improvement in understanding and performance.
The dataset chosen for this project was particularly original, capturing real examples of student questions, topics, and difficulty levels. These features enable the design and evaluation of models capable of understanding linguistic patterns associated with different educational stages.
